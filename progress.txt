# Ralph Process - Progress and Learnings

This file stores learnings, patterns, and context discovered during Ralph iterations.
It is append-only - never overwrite, only add new entries.

Each entry should include:
- Timestamp

[2026-01-15 12:00:00] Story 1.1: Project Setup & Repository Structure

Learnings:
- Monorepo structure already exists with apps/web, apps/api, packages/shared, packages/ui, packages/config, packages/db
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled in root and all packages
- ESLint and Prettier are configured with shared rules
- Husky pre-commit hooks are configured and working
- CI/CD pipeline exists in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Docker Compose was missing n8n and ComfyUI services - added them
- README needed architecture overview and development guidelines - enhanced it

Patterns:
- TypeScript path aliases require baseUrl to be set in tsconfig.json for proper resolution
- Next.js apps need @/* path alias configured in tsconfig.json with baseUrl
- Docker Compose services should include all required services (PostgreSQL, Redis, n8n, ComfyUI)

Gotchas:
- Pre-existing code in apps/api has linting errors (empty catch blocks, console statements, test files not in tsconfig)
- These are pre-existing issues and should be addressed in a separate code quality story
- ESLint configuration for API package needs to exclude test files or include them in tsconfig

Useful Context:
- Project uses Turborepo for monorepo management
- All packages extend root tsconfig.json for consistent TypeScript configuration
- Pre-commit hooks run: lint, format:check, type-check
- CI/CD pipeline runs: lint, format:check, type-check, test, build
- Docker Compose services: postgres (5432), redis (6379), n8n (5678), comfyui (8188)
