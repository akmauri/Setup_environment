# Project Overview Rules

## Project Context

This is an enterprise-level social media management web application that:
- Integrates with Gmail accounts via Google OAuth
- Creates social media accounts automatically when needed
- Generates AI-powered content
- Schedules and distributes content across multiple platforms
- Provides analytics and reporting

## Development Methodology

This project uses the **BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development)** methodology:
- AI agents work in iterative loops
- Tasks are broken down into small, focused units (Ralph-Wiggum tasks)
- Continuous integration and testing
- Automated code review and quality checks

## Key Principles

1. **Always refer to PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** for high-level requirements
2. **Break tasks into tiny, focused units** that can be completed in one iteration
3. **Test thoroughly** before considering any task complete
4. **Update documentation** as you learn and build
5. **Follow coding standards** defined in code-standards.mdc
6. **Think ahead** to ensure code fits with current and future requirements

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: React application
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express RESTful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching/Queues**: Redis
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0
- **Content Generation**: AI/ML Services
- **Task Queue**: Bull (Redis-based)

## Key Files

- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- `AGENTS.md`: AI agent instructions and workflow
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Technical architecture details
- `docs/EPICS_STORIES.md`: Development roadmap
- `docs/TASKS.md`: Current tasks and progress

## Non-Programming User Considerations

- Code should be well-documented with clear comments
- User-facing features should have intuitive interfaces
- Error messages should be user-friendly
- Documentation should explain concepts in plain language
