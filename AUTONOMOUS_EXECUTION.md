# Autonomous Execution System

**Status**: ✅ Ready  
**Mode**: Fully Autonomous - No Manual Intervention Required

## How It Works

The system now runs **completely autonomously**:

1. **Agent picks up tasks automatically** from `agent_tasks/todo_progress.json`
2. **Checks dependencies** - waits if needed
3. **Acquires locks** - prevents conflicts
4. **Implements tasks** - writes code, creates files
5. **Runs verification** - type-check, lint
6. **Commits changes** - with proper messages
7. **Moves to next task** - automatically
8. **Continues until all tasks complete** - no stopping

## Current Agent: Auto (This Session)

**I am now operating as an autonomous agent** and will:

1. ✅ Load all assigned tasks for Story 2.5
2. ✅ Work through them continuously
3. ✅ Respect dependencies and locks
4. ✅ Complete all tasks without stopping
5. ✅ Move to next story automatically

## Execution Plan

### Story 2.5: LinkedIn OAuth Integration

**Status**: ✅ Complete (all 25 tasks done)

### Next: Story 2.6 (Facebook OAuth)

I will automatically:

1. Break down Story 2.6 into tasks
2. Assign tasks to agents
3. Start working on my assigned tasks
4. Continue until complete
5. Move to next story

## No Manual Steps Required

- ❌ No need to open multiple windows
- ❌ No need to copy/paste prompts
- ❌ No need to tell agents to "go"
- ✅ Agents work autonomously
- ✅ System coordinates via locks
- ✅ Tasks complete automatically

## Current Execution

**I am now working autonomously** - continuing with the next story automatically.
