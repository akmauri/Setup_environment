## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

1. **Platform API Changes (High Risk):**
   - **Impact:** Features break if APIs change or deprecate
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor closely, build abstraction layers, maintain fallbacks
   - **Example:** Instagram Graph API deprecations

2. **Security Breach (High Risk):**
   - **Impact:** User data exposed, platform trust damaged
   - **Mitigation:** Bank-level encryption, regular audits, penetration testing
   - **Response Plan:** 72-hour breach notification, incident response team

3. **Scaling Challenges (Medium Risk):**
   - **Impact:** Performance degradation at scale
   - **Mitigation:** Auto-scaling infrastructure, database optimization, CDN
   - **Monitoring:** 24/7 uptime monitoring, alert thresholds

4. **AI Cost Overruns (Medium Risk):**
   - **Impact:** Margins compressed by AI API costs
   - **Mitigation:** 80% workload on self-hosted (ComfyUI, Ollama), smart model selection, caching
   - **Budget:** Cap AI costs per user, tier-based limits

5. **User Churn (Medium Risk):**
   - **Impact:** Revenue decline, negative growth
   - **Mitigation:** Excellent onboarding, responsive support, continuous feature improvements
   - **Monitoring:** Usage tracking, exit surveys

6. **Competition (Low Risk):**
   - **Impact:** Market share loss
   - **Mitigation:** Unique feature set (8 platforms + white-label), network effects (marketplace)
   - **Advantage:** First-mover in comprehensive multi-platform automation

   - Which models provide best quality/cost ratio?
   - How to handle model updates and deprecations?

4. **Marketplace Strategy:**
   - How to incentivize workflow creators?
   - What commission rate (30% seems standard)?
   - How to ensure workflow quality?

5. **Technical Architecture:**
   - Monorepo vs polyrepo?
   - Kubernetes from start or Docker Compose initially?
   - Which cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
