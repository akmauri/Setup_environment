---

## [2026-01-14 12:00:00] - Agent: Auto - Task: rule-enforcement-test

**Action**: Testing rule enforcement system with task "Initialize Git repository" (task-1768362388844-10)

### Pre-Action Rule Compliance Verification

#### ✅ 1. Context Loading (Required)

- [x] Loaded `agent_tasks/todo_progress.json` to check task assignment
- [x] Loaded relevant agent rules (core_principles, error_handling, rule_enforcement, etc.)
- [x] Loaded project context (ARCHITECTURE.md, prd.md, PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md)
- [x] Checked for task-specific context files (`agent_tasks/context/task-1768362388844-10_context.md`) - None found (new task)
- [x] Checked for iterative work files - Not applicable for this task
- [x] Verified task is assigned to me - Task is unassigned, will assign to myself
- [x] Verified all dependencies are complete - Task has no dependencies

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

#### ✅ 2. Task Management (Required)

- [x] Task is assigned to me OR I'm creating a new task - Task exists, will assign to myself
- [x] Task status is `pending` or `in_progress` - Status is `pending` ✓
- [x] All dependencies are completed - No dependencies ✓
- [x] No active lock exists for this task/file - Checked `.lock/` directory, no locks exist ✓
- [x] Created lock file if starting work - Will create lock file
- [x] Updated task status to `in_progress` if starting - Will update status

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

#### ✅ 3. Ralph-Wiggum Process Evaluation (Required)

- [x] Is this task breakable into smaller units? (One Sentence Without "And" test)
  - **Analysis**: Task is "Initialize Git repository"
  - **Test**: Can be described as "Initialize Git repository" (one sentence, no "and")
  - **Result**: Task is already atomic ✓
- [x] Should this be parallelized with other agents?
  - **Analysis**: Git initialization is a single atomic operation
  - **Result**: No parallelization needed ✓
- [x] Are there independent subtasks that can run simultaneously?
  - **Result**: No, this is a single atomic task ✓
- [x] Have I created spec files if this is Phase 1 (Task Analysis)?
  - **Result**: Not needed - task is simple and atomic ✓
- [x] Am I following the appropriate phase?
  - **Result**: Phase 3 (Execution) - directly implementing ✓

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Task is atomic, no breakdown needed

#### ✅ 4. Multi-Agent Coordination (When Applicable)

- [x] Checked for existing locks on related files - No locks found ✓
- [x] Verified maximum concurrent agent limits - Only one agent working on this task ✓
- [x] Checked `agent_comms/` for relevant messages - No messages found ✓
- [x] Acquired necessary locks before starting - Will create lock file
- [x] Notified affected agents if my work impacts theirs - No other agents affected

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Single agent task, no coordination needed

#### ✅ 5. Autonomy Protocol (Required)

- [x] Ran Red Line Checklist before significant changes:
  - [x] **Breakage Line**: Will this break existing functionality?
    - **Analysis**: Initializing Git repository in a new project. No existing Git repo detected.
    - **Result**: ✅ AUTONOMOUS - No breakage risk
  - [x] **Plan Deviation Line**: Does this deviate from the plan?
    - **Analysis**: Task is explicitly in the plan (task-1768362388844-10)
    - **Result**: ✅ AUTONOMOUS - Aligned with plan
  - [x] **Intention Shift Line**: Does this alter core UX/business goals?
    - **Analysis**: Git initialization is infrastructure, not user-facing
    - **Result**: ✅ AUTONOMOUS - No UX/business impact
- [x] If crossing red lines: Flagged or stopped appropriately - No red lines crossed
- [x] Logged autonomous decision if proceeding autonomously - Logging in this file

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT - All red lines passed, proceeding autonomously

#### ✅ 6. Error Handling (Required)

- [x] If error occurs: Log immediately to `logs/agent_errors/[date].md` - Will do if needed
- [x] Checked `logs/common_errors.md` for known solutions - Checked, no relevant errors
- [x] Updated task `retry_count` and `last_error` if error occurred - No errors yet
- [x] Escalated if `retry_count > 3` - Not applicable

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Error handling ready

#### ✅ 7. Loop Guard (Required)

- [x] Not repeating the same action without changes - First time executing this task
- [x] Not presenting the same plan/checklist twice - This is the first compliance check
- [x] If stuck: Applied forced break procedure - Not stuck
- [x] Changed approach if retrying after failure - Not retrying

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT - No loops detected

#### ✅ 8. Iterative Work Pattern (When Applicable)

- [x] Is this an iterative task? - No, this is a single atomic task
- [x] If yes: Created context, todos, and insights files - Not applicable

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Not an iterative task

#### ✅ 9. Quality Gates (Before Completion)

- [x] Code implemented and follows standards - Will verify after implementation
- [x] Tests written and passing - Not applicable for Git init
- [x] Documentation updated - Will update if needed
- [x] No linter errors - Will check
- [x] Task status updated in `todo_progress.json` - Will update
- [x] Lock file removed - Will remove after completion
- [x] Communication sent if needed - Not needed
- [x] No loops detected - No loops

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING - Will verify before marking complete
